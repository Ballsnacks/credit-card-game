## MEMORIZE THE CREDIT CARD NUMBERS

speed-memorizing credit card numbers is a very useful life skill and you should get better at it

to play, literally just clone the repository or download *credit_cards.py*, and run

    python3 credit_cards.py
nothing else*. no dependencies. just one file. try it

**python3 required*


### this is what it looks like
or should look like depending on if your terminal supports all these cool colors and unicode symbols
![this is the first screenshot](/images/image1.png)

important feature you should know about: *it also randomizes names, bank logos and colours every time*

![this is the second screenshot](/images/image2.png)

important feature 2 you should know about: *it also randomizes these red and green words and you're welcome to suggest words to add to the list, submit a pull request :-)*


### choose between two modes:
 - unlimited time
 - time-limited

to set a time limit, just run the script with an optional argument:

    python3 credit_cards.py [seconds]

like, for example, 5 seconds:

    python3 credit_cards.py 5
  but use something bigger than 5. you probably can't do it in 5 seconds (yet). hopefully, you soon will, with the use of this invaluable tool



*disclaimer: whenever memorizing credit card numbers, it's good practice to check that the card owner consents to the activity. consent is important*
